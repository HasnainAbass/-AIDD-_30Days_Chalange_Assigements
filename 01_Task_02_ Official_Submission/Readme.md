📝 Task 2 — AI-Driven Development (AIDD)

## 1. Nine Pillars Understanding
### a) Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?

Using AI development agents for repetitive setup tasks saves time and removes the boring parts of coding.
Instead of doing the same setup again and again, the AI handles it for you.

This gives you more time and mental space to focus on architecture, system design, and workflow planning — the skills that actually make you a strong system architect.
You grow faster because you're working on high-level thinking instead of manual setup.

### b) How do the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer?

The Nine Pillars cover the full cycle of AI-driven development — planning, prompting, testing, reviewing, debugging, and documenting.

By practicing these pillars:

You learn multiple skills, not just coding

You become strong in architecture, communication, evaluation, and AI collaboration

You learn how to guide AI tools and check their outputs like a senior engineer

This blend of skills shapes you into an M-Shaped Developer — someone who is skilled in different areas and can work effectively with AI.

## 2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development
### a) Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?

Vibe Coding means starting the code without a plan.
It feels fast at first, but soon:

Files become messy

Logic breaks

New features don’t fit

Bugs increase

No one remembers why something was written

After a week, the project becomes confusing and difficult to continue.
This is why vibe coding often leads to chaos.

### b) How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?

Specification-driven development starts with a clear plan — what the system should do and how features will work.

With specs:

Features fit perfectly into the structure

AI tools generate consistent code

The project stays organized

Adding new features is easier

Bugs are minimized

Specs act like a roadmap.
They keep the project clean, stable, and future-proof.

## 3. Architecture Thinking
### a) How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?

Architecture-first thinking changes the developer’s role from “just writing code”
to becoming:

A system planner

A designer

A problem solver

A decision-maker

In AIDD, AI writes most of the raw code.
The developer becomes the person who designs the system, guides AI, and makes strategic decisions.

### b) Why must developers think in layers and systems instead of raw code?

Thinking in layers helps developers understand how all parts of the application connect — frontend, backend, database, APIs, and deployment.

If you think only in code:

You miss the bigger picture

Features break easily

The system becomes hard to scale

But when you think in systems:

Your software becomes organized

Features integrate smoothly

AI tools generate better, cleaner output

The whole system works as one unit

Great developers build systems, not just lines of code.
